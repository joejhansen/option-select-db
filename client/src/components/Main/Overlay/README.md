# ABOUT THE OVERLAY

This feature has been scrapped or otherwise abandoned because of the need for realtime file reads and the trickiness of that with CORS. It's also a little outside of the scope of a database, so would just be a cherry on top of the other functions. 

Perhaps allow for installable app so as to fix this. IDK. If you have any ideas, submit a PR.
