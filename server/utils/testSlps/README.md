# ABOUT SLP FILES AND THEIR JSON DATA

## DO NOT OPEN testSlpParse.json OR testSlpParseFrames.json!!!!

If you want to look at these files, I suggest using a different instance of your IDE to do so. If you're not careful, your IDE may crash (looking at you, VSCode).

Although only ~20mb of data earch, Both of these files are over 70K lines long with the JSON.stringify(data, null, 2) settings.
