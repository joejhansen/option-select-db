# option-select-overlay
Track and display your greatest moments in Melee with the Option Select Overlay

## Original Scope

The original intent of this project was for an overlay that uses slp-realtime in order to cast information to a stream, but CORS makes that difficult so would be better suited for a fork with electron.

## Current Scope

Upload your .slp files to a searchable compendium using the site or its API. 


### Search Functionality
Look up display names, connect codes, and individual games associated with them to analyze combos, conversions, and anything else slippi-js provides.

### Head-to-Head Analysis
Compare connect codes to see match histories and analytics
